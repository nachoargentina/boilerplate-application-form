# boilerplate-application-form

## Overview

This is Ignacio Antonelli implementation of Task 3 of the Multi-step application submission flow on [this link](https://www.notion.so/Build-a-multi-step-application-submission-flow-119b69a844bb4a3a86c587374c9e3551)

## Running the app

You should start by installing all package running
```
yarn install
```

The app uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock a full REST API. You will need to have the server running for the app to work.
To do so simply run 
```
yarn json-server
```

Once the server is running you can start the app with 
```
yarn dev
```
